# Databricks → SqlDBM DDL Importer (PoC)

An interactive Databricks notebook that reads table/view DDL straight from your
**Unity Catalog or Hive metastore** and pushes it into **SqlDBM** through the public
REST API — as a new project, a new revision on an existing project, or a revision on a
Concurrent-Working branch.

The whole experience runs from a single notebook cell: a three-line bootstrap fetches
`import.py` from this repo and renders a guided, four-step form.

---

## Quick start

Paste this into a notebook cell and run it:

```python
import urllib.request
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sqldbmcorp/poc-databricks-re-notebook/refs/heads/main/import.py"
exec(compile(urllib.request.urlopen(url).read().decode(), "import.py", "exec"), globals())
```

`exec(..., globals())` runs the script in the notebook's namespace so it inherits `spark`
and renders the widgets inline. Then:

1. Check the **Environment preflight** banner at the top — all four rows should be green
   (Compute is informational). Hover any row label for an explanation.
2. **Step 1** — pick a catalog and schema(s), click *Generate DDL*.
3. **Step 2** — review the object list; uncheck anything you don't want; *Preview DDL to
   Continue*.
4. **Step 3** — confirm the DDL.
5. **Step 4** — paste your API token, click *Connect & load projects*, choose your
   destination, and *Submit*.

> GitHub's raw CDN caches for a few minutes, so a freshly pushed change to `import.py`
> may take a moment to appear. During development you can append a cache-buster, e.g.
> `url + f"?v={time.time()}"`.

## Why this exists

SqlDBM customers frequently already have their schemas defined in Databricks and want to
reverse-engineer them into a SqlDBM data model. The manual path is tedious — export DDL,
clean it up, paste or upload it, repeat per schema. Network security requirements often
prevent SqlDBM users from connecting to their Databricks environment directly from the application, 
so an in-app reverse-engineer isn't always an option. This notebook automates that round trip — running
the extraction inside the cluster, where the data already is — and keeps a human in the loop
where it matters:

- **Pulls DDL where it lives.** Reads directly from the catalog/metastore on the cluster,
  so there's no intermediate file to manage or lose.
- **Object-level control.** You pick the catalog and schema(s), then review and de-select
  individual objects before anything is sent.
- **Pushes via the SqlDBM API.** Creates a project, a revision on the latest, a revision on
  a chosen revision, or routes through a branch for Concurrent-Working projects.
- **Consistent with the SqlDBM app.** Extraction uses the same Spark primitives
  (`setCurrentCatalog` → `listTables` → `SHOW CREATE TABLE`) as SqlDBM's own
  reverse-engineering tool, so the generated DDL matches what the product would produce.
- **Honest about restricted environments.** A built-in preflight reports compute type,
  Unity Catalog vs Hive metastore, and endpoint reachability, so users on locked-down or
  government clouds see what will and won't work before they start.

## What it does

When the bootstrap runs, the notebook renders an **Environment preflight** banner followed
by a four-step accordion (only one step open at a time):

1. **Configure Source Catalog and Schema(s)** — choose a catalog, select one or more
   schemas, and click *Generate DDL*.
2. **Configure Objects to Import** — every discovered object appears as a checkbox
   (grouped by schema, DDL hidden behind a caret). Filter by name, *Select all* /
   *Deselect all*, then *Preview DDL to Continue*.
3. **DDL Confirmation** — review the exact DDL that will be sent, then *Confirm*.
4. **Configure Destination Project** — enter your SqlDBM API token, connect, choose a
   destination (new project or existing), branch (for Concurrent-Working projects), and
   revision target, then *Submit*. On success you get direct links to the project (and
   branch, when applicable).

## Prerequisites

**SqlDBM**

- A **Standard Enterprise** SqlDBM account.
- **API access enabled** for your account (request it via your Account Manager or a support
  ticket).
- A **personal SqlDBM API token with GET+POST scope** — the importer both reads your projects and
  branches and writes revisions, so it needs both. Generate one under **Account → App Tokens**.

**Databricks**

- A workspace with **Unity Catalog** or a **Hive metastore** (both are supported).
- **Databricks Runtime 13.x or newer** recommended — the extraction uses
  `spark.catalog.setCurrentCatalog`, `listTables`, and `listDatabases`, which require
  Spark 3.4+. (This is the same baseline SqlDBM's own tool requires.)
- **`ipywidgets`**, available on current DBR and serverless compute.
- **Unity Catalog / metastore read access** to the schemas you want to import.
- **Outbound HTTPS** from the cluster to `api.sqldbm.com` and (for the bootstrap)
  `raw.githubusercontent.com`.

## The environment preflight

The preflight runs automatically on load (and has a *Re-run environment checks* button). It
reports:

- **Compute** — cluster type (*Classic cluster* vs *Serverless / Spark Connect*) and the
  Databricks Runtime version. This is the compute, **not** the metastore.
- **Catalogs / UC** — whether Unity Catalog is enabled or the workspace is
  Hive-metastore-only, plus the current catalog and the full `SHOW CATALOGS` list.
- **SqlDBM API** — GETs `https://api.sqldbm.com/swagger/v1/swagger.json` and expects
  HTTP 200, confirming the cluster can reach the SqlDBM REST API.
- **Script host** — confirms the cluster can fetch `import.py` from GitHub.

Any non-passing check prints a plain-language note explaining how to remediate it.

---

## Concurrent Working (branches)

For Concurrent-Working (CW) projects, SqlDBM doesn't allow writing to `main` directly. The
form detects CW (more than one branch, or any non-`main` branch) and reveals a **Branch**
picker: choose an existing branch, or create a new one (pre-named
`databricks-import/<user>-<timestamp>`). Submissions are then routed through the
branch-scoped API endpoints, and the success message links to both `main` and the target
branch.

---

## Security & tokens

- The API token is entered in a **masked** field and is used only to call the SqlDBM API
  from your cluster. It is not written to disk or logged by the script.
- The SqlDBM API token governs what projects the user can push to; the importer can only
  do what the token is scoped for.
